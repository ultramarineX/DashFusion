# DashFusion: Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (IEEE T-NNLS 2025)

Code for the paper "**DashFusion: Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis**". [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05515)

## ✨ Overview

**DashFusion** is a novel framework for multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), which contains dual-stream alignment with hierarchical bottleneck fusion. First, the dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention (CA) to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Second, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion (HBF) progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

## 🔨 Installation

Dataset: The dataset is available for download at https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA

Environment: Our code is built on python version 3.9 & pytorch version 1.13.1.

```
conda create -n dashfusion python=3.9
conda activate dashfusion
git clone https://github.com/ultramarineX/DashFusion/
cd DashFusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Choose the dataset in config.py, and then run main.py.

```
python main.py
```

### NOTE

In paper section IV.D, we made a mistake that the layer of transformer encoders in audio and vision encoder. In fact, for MOSI and SIMS, the layer is 2, for MOSEI, the layer is 4. These errors have been corrected in the config.py file.
